            <p> Well for starters thank you for stopping by my website! I'm from sunny California a place I have called home my whole life, 
                grew up in the Bay Area as well as the central valley. Right out of high school I enrolled 
                in a trade school in Sacramento named Univeral Technical Institute where I studied Automotive
                technology. Upon finishing I went and worked at a Toyota dealership in Redood City, it was a fun 
                and simple enviornment, although I was only a lube technician I otherwise gained valueable inforation
                during my tenure.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Eventually I went on a trained with the STEP program in Arizona. During my time there I specialized for BMW, in the course 
                of some time I became a certified BMW technician. Having worked at the dealership for 6 years, this was a great and treasured time of my life.
                Having met numerous characters from all types of backgrounds, being the new guy was not entirely easy, however, my Team Leader and fellow
                co-workers otherwise proved to be invaluble in shaping my experience.
            </p>
        </br />
        <p>I am now shaping my new journey as I type this message, it will be updated along the way. I am equally excited, anxious and hopeful of what the 
            future will bring. 5 years ago I would have never imagined leaving my career in pursuit of another, however, here we are defying the odds and breaking 
            molds that to most would have otherwise been permanent. Where I pursuit a degree in Computer Science.  Welcome!
