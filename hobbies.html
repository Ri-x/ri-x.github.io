                    <p>All the training up until tihs point was not comparable to what had to be done for BMW. Where electrial
                        diagnosis can make or break a successful diagnosis there was plenty to be learned.

                    As time went on the sensation of riding on the street no longer scracthed that itch and I had to endeavor in another
                    niche. Riding on the track
                    was an eye opener, my ego may have been inflated by the time I hit the track and was I humbled. The feeling of
                    starting from zero wasn't exactly
                    to my liking but I learned more in my first year of riding on track that I ever did on the street.

                        Cycling is hobby that allows me the explore the crevices present around the bay area. Mainly sticking to the trails
                        around the South Bay, nevertheless, it
                        has introduced me to areas in which I would have never known. From the Guadalupe trail to the Bay Trail, from
                        Downtown San Jose to Palo Alto, cycling has
                        given me not only great exercise but that ability to explore. I desire to eventually make my way towards criterium
                        cycling events, this would be the next
                        step towards a harsher and much more competitive atmosphere.

                        I'm also open minded, making this website is somewhat of a hobby in of itself, taking the time to build this site
                        from scratch was no easy feat. I took great influcnce
                        from another website and attempted to build on my own.
