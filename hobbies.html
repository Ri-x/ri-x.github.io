        <p>I have always had the facination of riding a motorcycle, a combination of looking cool and the feelings of envy filled my mind. As cliche as it
            may sound when I would run into a motorcyclist on the freeway or in town they always seemed to be "free", the envy came from seeing them cut 
        traffic while I sat there and waited without a way out of the jam. </p>

            As time went on the sensation of riding on the street no longer scracthed that itch and I had to endeavor in another niche. Riding on the track 
            was an eye opener, my ego may have been inflated by the time I hit the track and was I humbled. The feeling of starting from zero wasn't exactly
            to my liking but I learned more in my first year of riding on track that I ever did on the street.

            Cycling is hobby that allows me the explore the crevices present around the bay area. Mainly sticking to the trails around the South Bay, nevertheless, it 
            has introduced me to areas in which I would have never known. From the Guadalupe trail to the Bay Trail, from Downtown San Jose to Palo Alto, cycling has
            given me great exercise.
