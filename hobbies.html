                    <p>
                    As time went on the sensation of riding on the street no longer scracthed that itch and I had to endeavor in another
                    niche. Riding on the track
                    was an eye opener, my ego may have been inflated by the time I hit the track and was I humbled. The feeling of
                    starting from zero wasn't exactly
                    to my liking but I learned more in my first year of riding on track that I ever did on the street.

                    <p>
                        Cycling is hobby that allows me the explore the crevices present around the bay area. Mainly sticking to the trails
                        around the South Bay, nevertheless, it
                        has introduced me to areas in which I would have never known. From the Guadalupe trail to the Bay Trail, from
                        Downtown San Jose to Palo Alto, cycling has
                        given me not only great exercise but that ability to explore. I desire to eventually make my way towards criterium
                        cycling events, this would be the next
                        step towards a harsher and much more competitive atmosphere.

                    <p>
                        Initally starting off with little league baseball it was time to try my hand at another sport, evidently falling in love with what 
                        is appropriately called the beautiful game. Striker, mid fielder and eventually finding my best in defense, right-back defender. 
                        It's not an easy task guarding your half of the field, it comes with its momemnts of glee and grief, however, even with it all I would 
                        not trade it with any other sport. Wishing to return for friendly pickups.

                    <p>
                        I wouldn't strictly consider this a hobby but I do thouroughly enjoy trainning. Being thinner that I would like descipling myself
                        to not only go to the gym but remain relatively tight in regards to diet has translated well in areas besides the gym.
