<hr />
<p>I have always had this fascination with builing, ever since I was a kid. 
    Perhaps that is why I gravitated towards the automotive field.
    Imagine large and expensive legos. There is more at stake I do concur, however,
    it served me well all those years and I don't have any regrets.
